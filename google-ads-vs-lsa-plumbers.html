          <strong>Audience:</strong> Plumbing Business Owners
        </div>

        <p>
          If you run a plumbing business and want more phone calls, you’ve probably heard about
          both Google Ads and Google Local Services Ads (LSA).
        </p>

        <p>
          On paper, both platforms promise more leads. In reality, they work very differently —
          and choosing the wrong one can waste thousands of dollars.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this guide, we’ll break down how each platform works, what plumbers can realistically
          expect, and which option makes the most sense for your business.
        </p>

        <!-- IMAGE 1 -->
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/google-ads-vs-lsa/1.png" alt="Plumber showing Google Local Services Ads and Google Ads on smartphone" loading="lazy">

        <h2>What Are Local Services Ads (LSA)?</h2>

        <p>
          Local Services Ads appear at the very top of Google search results, above traditional ads
          and organic listings. These ads show your business with reviews, location, and the
          “Google Guaranteed” badge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of paying per click, you pay per lead — when someone calls or messages your
          business directly through the ad.
        </p>

        <p>
          For plumbers, this is powerful because most users who click LSA ads are already looking
          to hire someone immediately.
        </p>

        <!-- IMAGE 2 -->
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/google-ads-vs-lsa/2.png" alt="Google Local Services Ads results for emergency plumber near me" loading="lazy">

        <h2>How Google Ads Works for Plumbers</h2>

        <p>
          Google Ads (Search Ads) show up below Local Services Ads and allow you to bid on keywords
          like “emergency plumber near me” or “drain cleaning service.”
        </p>

        <p>
          With Google Ads, you pay for every click — whether the person becomes a customer or not.
          This gives you more control, but also more risk if campaigns aren’t managed properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          When structured correctly, Google Ads can generate consistent volume and scale faster
          than LSA alone.
        </p>

        <!-- IMAGE 3 -->
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/google-ads-vs-lsa/3.png" alt="Google Ads and Local Services Ads comparison on desktop search results" loading="lazy">

        <h2>Lead Quality Comparison</h2>

        <p>
          In most plumbing markets, Local Services Ads tend to produce higher-quality leads.
          Customers trust the Google Guaranteed badge and are usually ready to book.
        </p>

        <p>
          Google Ads can generate strong leads too, but they often include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Price shoppers</li>
          <li>Research-only visitors</li>
          <li>Comparison shoppers</li>
          <li>Out-of-area clicks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Without strong filtering and negatives, Google Ads can attract low-intent traffic.
        </p>

        <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>

        <p>
          Local Services Ads typically cost between $25–$80 per lead for plumbers, depending on
          location and competition.
        </p>

        <p>
          Google Ads costs vary widely. In competitive markets, plumbers often pay $15–$40 per click.
          A few bad clicks can quickly drain a budget.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Google Ads can produce lower cost-per-lead in some markets, it requires
          ongoing optimization.
        </p>

        <!-- IMAGE 4 -->
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/google-ads-vs-lsa/4.png" alt="Infographic comparing Google Local Services Ads and Google Ads for plumbers" loading="lazy">

        <h2>Setup and Management Difficulty</h2>

        <p>
          Local Services Ads require background checks, insurance verification, and profile
          approval. Once approved, setup is fairly simple.
        </p>

        <p>
          Google Ads requires more technical skill:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Keyword research</li>
          <li>Ad copywriting</li>
          <li>Landing page optimization</li>
          <li>Conversion tracking</li>
          <li>Bid management</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Without experience, most plumbing companies struggle to make Google Ads profitable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="major-heading">Which Platform Is Better for Most Plumbers?</h2>

        <p>
          For most plumbing businesses, the best approach is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start with Local Services Ads</strong> for stable, high-intent leads</li>
          <li><strong>Add Google Ads</strong> once LSA is performing consistently</li>
          <li><strong>Use both together</strong> for maximum market coverage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          LSA provides reliability. Google Ads provides scalability.
          When combined, they create a strong lead generation system.
        </p>

        <!-- IMAGE 5 -->
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/google-ads-vs-lsa/5.png" alt="Plumbing business growth with Google Ads and Local Services Ads strategy" loading="lazy">

        <h2>Common Mistakes Plumbers Make</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Running Google Ads without call tracking</li>
          <li>Leaving LSA profiles unoptimized</li>
          <li>Ignoring lead disputes</li>
          <li>Overbidding in competitive zones</li>
          <li>Not answering calls fast enough</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Advertising only works when paired with strong follow-up systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>

        <p>
          If you’re choosing between Google Ads and Local Services Ads, start with LSA.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you’ve built consistency, layer in Google Ads to expand volume and protect
          yourself from algorithm changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plumbers who win long-term are the ones who build systems — not just campaigns.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:13px; color:#6b7280; margin-top:40px;">
          Results vary based on market competition, budget, seasonality, and follow-up processes.
