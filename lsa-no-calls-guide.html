        <h1>Why You’re Not Getting Calls from Local Services Ads (and Exactly What to Do)</h1>

        <p>
          This guide is a troubleshooting playbook — a practical walkthrough you can use to diagnose why your LSA profile is visible but producing few or no calls, and to fix the issues that actually move the needle. Work through the quick checklist first, then follow the ordered flow and copy-paste templates to resolve the problem today.
        </p>

        <h2>Short answer (for featured snippets)</h2>
        <p>
          Most “LSA no calls” problems stem from one or more of these: <strong>incomplete verification</strong>, <strong>weak profile conversion signals</strong> (reviews/photos/description), <strong>missed or slow call handling</strong>, <strong>service-area or category mismatch</strong>, <strong>low local demand</strong>, or <strong>technical call-routing</strong> issues. Fix verification and responsiveness first, then improve reviews and targeting.
        </p>

        <h2>Quick diagnostic checklist (2 minutes)</h2>
        <p>
          Before you dig into the details, check these high-impact items:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account status: Active / Verified (not Under Review or Suspended)</li>
          <li>Impressions vs calls: are you getting impressions but no calls?</li>
          <li>Recent reviews: any in the last 90 days? Overall rating above 4.5?</li>
          <li>Service area: set correctly and not overly broad?</li>
          <li>Call routing: forwarding numbers tested and working?</li>
          <li>Lead disputes: did you recently decline or dispute many leads?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The 12 most common reasons (and how to fix each)</h2>

        <h3>1) Verification or approval is incomplete</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Dashboard shows “Under review” or pending documents. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Upload exactly the documents requested (license, insurance, IDs). Save screenshots of uploads with timestamps. If verification stalls for more than 7 days, open a support ticket and include the verification/task ID and your proof of submission.
        </p>

        <h3>2) You have impressions but zero calls — poor conversion</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Impressions > 0 but Calls = 0. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Improve trust and relevancy: get recent reviews, show job photos, tighten your primary service, and write a short, clear business description that matches common search phrases (e.g., “emergency plumber,” “24/7 HVAC repair”).
        </p>

        <h3>3) Low or stale reviews</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Few recent reviews or rating below ~4.5. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Implement a review system: one-click SMS link after jobs, a quick in-person script for techs, and automatic reminders. Respond publicly and professionally to negative reviews.
        </p>

        <h3>4) Lead quality problems (spam, duplicates, out-of-area)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Many leads aren’t actual jobs you want. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Tighten ZIP codes, limit listed services to what you perform well, add screening questions to your call script, and document invalid leads thoroughly before disputing in the dashboard.
        </p>

        <h3>5) Missed calls or slow response</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Missed calls, voicemail, or long callback delays. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Assign a dedicated LSA responder; use an answering service trained to qualify and schedule; set a 10–15 minute callback SLA and track answer-time KPI.
        </p>

        <h3>6) Budget vs demand mismatch</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Budget not spent or very low lead volume despite an active profile. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> LSA delivery is demand-driven — confirm your categories and test neighboring ZIPs with proven demand before increasing budget.
        </p>

        <h3>7) Suspensions or policy flags</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Suspension notice or policy email. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Follow reinstatement instructions, gather requested documents, and escalate to support with the suspension code if the issue is unclear.
        </p>

        <h3>8) Overly broad or incorrect service area</h3>
        <p>
          **Fix:** Focus on dense ZIPs where you already have customers. Expand only after the profile shows stable performance in core areas.
        </p>

        <h3>9) Competitors outrank you</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Audit competitor profiles for review counts and response speeds. Improve review velocity, response time, and consider targeting narrower niche services to win targeted queries.
        </p>

        <h3>10) Call routing or tracking is broken</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Test calls drop, forwarding fails, or no calls logged. <br>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Test routing from multiple carriers/devices, validate call-tracking scripts, and keep a short manual log of test calls to confirm delivery.
        </p>

        <h3>11) Messaging leads are enabled but ignored</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Forward message alerts to email/SMS or disable messaging leads if you won’t monitor them.
        </p>

        <h3>12) Seasonal or market-wide demand drops</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> Accept seasonality, expand temporarily into adjacent areas, diversify services, or run a short promotional offer to boost conversions during slow months.
        </p>

        <h2>Step-by-step troubleshooting flow (use this in order)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Confirm account status (Active & Verified).</li>
          <li>If impressions = 0 → check verification, categories, and service area.</li>
          <li>If impressions > 0 but calls = 0 → fix conversion signals (reviews, photos, description).</li>
          <li>If calls are poor quality → tighten area, refine services, add screening, and document disputes.</li>
          <li>If calls are missed → fix routing and assign a dedicated responder.</li>
          <li>If everything looks fine but volume is low → test adjacent ZIPs and consider a short Search Ads pilot for demand data.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Copy-paste scripts & templates</h2>

        <h3>Review request SMS (one-click link)</h3>
        <pre style="background:#fff; padding:12px; border-radius:8px; border:1px solid #eef2f7;">
Hi [First name], thanks for choosing [Company]. If we did a great job, could you leave a quick 1-minute review? [one-click review link] — it helps small businesses like ours. Thanks!
        </pre>

        <h3>Call screening opener</h3>
        <pre style="background:#fff; padding:12px; border-radius:8px; border:1px solid #eef2f7;">
Thanks for calling [Company]. This is [Name]. Is this an emergency or a routine appointment? Great — what’s the address and the best callback number?
        </pre>

        <h3>Dispute lead template (to Google support)</h3>
        <pre style="background:#fff; padding:12px; border-radius:8px; border:1px solid #eef2f7;">
Account: [account ID]
Lead ID: [lead ID]
Date/time: [date]
Reason: wrong service / spam / duplicate
Attached: call log transcript / screenshot / technician note
Please review and refund/mark invalid.
        </pre>

        <h2>KPIs to track weekly</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Impressions → Calls → Bookings (conversion rates at each step)</li>
          <li>Median call answer time (minutes)</li>
          <li>Invalid leads vs disputes won</li>
          <li>New reviews per 30/60/90 days</li>
          <li>Lead cost (if tracking spend vs leads)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to call LSA support</h2>
        <p>
          Contact support if verification is stuck > 7 days, if your account is suspended without a clear reason, or if you suspect a technical issue with call routing or duplicate leads. Ask for the task/suspension ID and the exact checklist of documents they need.
        </p>

        <h2>Common mistakes that kill LSA performance</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Assuming LSA is “set-and-forget” — it needs weekly attention.</li>
          <li>Disputing too many leads without documentation (hurts dispute success rate).</li>
          <li>Setting an overly broad service area that dilutes relevancy.</li>
          <li>Passing calls to an untrained voicemail or third party that can’t schedule jobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quick action plan — do this today</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Confirm account is Active & Verified.</li>
          <li>Review last 30 days: impressions vs calls ratio.</li>
          <li>Push for 3 recent reviews (SMS + ask at completion).</li>
          <li>Test call routing with 5 manual calls and log results.</li>
          <li>Tighten service area by removing problem ZIPs.</li>
          <li>Create a short LSA script and assign one person to handle LSA leads.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>FAQ (short answers for snippets)</h2>

        <h3>Are reviews the only ranking factor?</h3>
        <p>No — reviews are important, but Google also considers responsiveness, booking rate, proximity, and profile completeness.</p>

        <h3>Will raising my budget get more calls?</h3>
        <p>Not automatically. Budget helps only when there is sufficient qualified demand in your area and category. Prioritize relevance and conversion first.</p>

        <h3>How fast should I answer LSA calls?</h3>
        <p>Aim to answer live within 20 seconds and return missed leads within 10–15 minutes.</p>
