        <div class="tagline">Focused on Local Leads That Convert</div>

        <div class="about-text">
          Blue Grid Media is a performance-focused digital marketing agency built to help local service businesses generate real, qualified leads through Google Local Services Ads (LSAs).
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="about-text">
          We don’t try to do everything. We specialize exclusively in setting up, optimizing, and managing Google Local Services Ads so local businesses get more calls, better lead quality, and a stronger return on ad spend.
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="about-text">
          Our team is made up of experienced marketers who have spent years working with local and professional service businesses through agency roles and hands-on freelance work. Collectively, we’ve worked with hundreds of Local Services Ads accounts across industries such as plumbing, HVAC, electrical, roofing, landscaping, cleaning services, and other home service businesses.
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="about-text">
          We’ve seen what actually impacts LSA performance — and what doesn’t. That experience allows us to avoid guesswork and focus on what drives rankings, lead quality, and cost efficiency.
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="about-text">
          <strong>How We Work</strong><br><br>
          Local Services Ads aren’t set-it-and-forget-it. Real results come from proper setup, continuous monitoring, and ongoing optimization. Our process is practical and data-driven, focusing on clean account structure, correct service categories and areas, smart budgeting, and regular lead quality reviews.
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="about-text">
          <strong>Why Clients Choose Us</strong><br><br>
          Clients work with Blue Grid Media because we specialize exclusively in LSAs, communicate clearly, move quickly, and focus on real performance metrics — not vanity numbers. We’re comfortable working directly with business owners or supporting agencies behind the scenes.
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="about-text">
          <strong>Who We’re a Good Fit For</strong><br><br>
          We work best with local service businesses that rely on inbound calls and care about lead quality, not just volume. If you’re looking for shortcuts or gimmicks, we’re probably not the right fit. If you want a structured, honest approach to LSAs, we’d be happy to help.
