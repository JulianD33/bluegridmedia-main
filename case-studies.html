        <strong>Industry:</strong> HVAC (Repair & Installation)<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Illinois, USA<br>
        <strong>Primary Channels:</strong> Google Local Services Ads, Google Search Ads
      </div>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2023, the owner of an HVAC business in Illinois reached out for help with
        underperforming Google Local Services Ads (LSA). While the business had seen
        increased profitability earlier in the year, lead volume and consistency became
        unpredictable as Google’s LSA ranking factors evolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal was twofold: stabilize and scale LSA performance, then expand into
        Google Search Ads to capture additional high-intent demand.
      </p>

      <h2>Full LSA Review</h2>
      <p>
        A full audit of call recordings and lead quality revealed that the majority of
        qualified callers came from the same nearby areas, aligning with Google’s increased
        emphasis on proximity. Repair requests—especially furnace and heater repairs—
        dominated demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The LSA profile itself was strong, requiring only minor updates. However, availability
        constraints and Google Business Profile (GBP) optimizations were impacting rankings
        and delivery.
      </p>

      <h2>LSA Optimization</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed underperforming service categories to focus budget on high-converting repair services</li>
        <li>Switched to manual weekly budgeting for improved pacing and visibility control</li>
        <li>Monitored daily spend to prevent early capping and overspend</li>
        <li>Paused LSA during full booking periods to protect job completion signals</li>
        <li>Narrowed geo-targeting to prioritize proximity-driven, high-call areas</li>
        <li>Optimized GBP with updated photos, review responses, and service details</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>LSA Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>28% increase in qualified leads within the first three months</li>
        <li>Repair inquiries increased from 55% to 75% of total calls</li>
        <li>15% reduction in cost per lead</li>
        <li>Improved lead consistency and fewer invalid disputes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Google Ads Expansion</h2>
      <p>
        With LSA performance stabilized, the next step was expanding reach through
        Google Search Ads to capture high-intent users slightly outside the core proximity
        zone while maintaining cost efficiency.
      </p>

      <h2>The Google Ads Strategy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Search-only campaigns (Search Partners excluded)</li>
        <li>One campaign with three tightly themed ad groups</li>
        <li>5–10 core keywords per ad group</li>
        <li>One dedicated landing page per service</li>
        <li>Quality Score–first structure prioritizing relevance over aggressive bidding</li>
        <li>Full asset coverage (sitelinks, callouts, pricing, emergency messaging)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Optimization Process</h2>
      <p>
        Early performance focused on data collection rather than volume. Underperforming
        keywords were paused, negatives were added, and bids were refined manually before
        transitioning into conversion-based bidding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repairs dominated demand, accounting for roughly 65% of clicks, with maintenance
        following at approximately 25%.
      </p>

      <h2>Google Ads Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>8% CTR (above the HVAC industry average)</li>
        <li>Average Quality Score of 7/10 across ad groups</li>
        <li>45 qualified leads generated within three months</li>
        <li>$62 average cost per lead</li>
        <li>Approximately 4× ROAS from booked jobs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Overall Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Combined LSA and Google Search efforts resulted in an estimated 40% increase in
        booked jobs, creating a more stable and scalable acquisition system.
      </p>

        Results vary based on budget, competition, seasonality, and follow-up processes.
